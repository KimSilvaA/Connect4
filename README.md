# Connect4
AMS561 Final Project 

Project Objectives and Significance
Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The first player to connect four of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. With a 7-column by 6-row board, the number of possible board configurations exceeds 4.5 trillion. This makes Connect 4 an ideal game for exploring artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly those used in game theory and decision-making strategies.
Our project aims to build an AI-powered Connect 4 solver that not only simulates gameplay, but also evaluates and scores board states. By incorporating deterministic algorithms such as minimax and negamax, the solver provides feedback and decision-making throughout the game. The system assesses the game state after every move, determining whether a player has won, if the game has ended in a draw, or if further play is possible. The project highlights fundamental principles in data science—such as search space optimization, evaluation heuristics, and real-time feedback—and applies them in an interactive and engaging context.
In addition to the AI component, the project includes a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI), allowing human users to play against the AI and visually track game progress. 
Team Contributions
Ariadna converted the functional code into an object-oriented structure and designed the graphical user interface using Pygame. She implemented user interactions, board rendering, game state updates, and animations. Ariadna also helped incorporate the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and integrated all components into the final game loop.
Sara was responsible for implementing the core game logic, including piece dropping, win condition checking, and board evaluation functions. She integrated Numpy for efficient manipulation of the game board and applied the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI-decision making system. She also contributed to testing and debugging to ensure the accuracy and performance of the game logic.
